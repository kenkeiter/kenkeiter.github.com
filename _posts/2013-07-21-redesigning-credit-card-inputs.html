    title: Redesigning the Credit Card Input
    description: >-
        Ken Keiter takes a shot at redesigning the credit card input, and 
        presents Skeuocard – a new library/paradigm for accepting credit card 
        information on the web.

    I remember the first time I went through the checkout process online. I 
    can't remember what I was buying, but I remember the experience. I had just 
    filled out my billing address, when I was presented with a place to enter 
    my credit card information: an array of fields with a select box, laid out 
    in a table with these six-pixel-thick, beveled borders. It had instructions 
    at the top. Enter your date in this format. Put spaces between each number 
    grouping. It looked and felt as though it had been constructed by Soviet 
    scientists during the cold war.
</p>
<p>
    For the most part, with the exception of the beveled borders, this 
    describes credit card inputs as they exist today.
</p>
<p>
    As designers and engineers, our job is to look at the world and try to 
    figure out why things are the way they are. The <em>feel</em> of buying 
    something online is vastly different than the feel of purchasing something 
    in the real world. The core of a purchasing experience is not only about 
    getting the right data from the user you're selling to, and shipping them 
    this product -- it's in the significance of the <em>exchange</em>. I give 
    you something, and in return, I get something.
</p>
<p>
    Designing a simple, efficient, and enjoyable online purchasing experience 
    is very much about striving to inspire the same feelings in your user as 
    those of a person making a purchase in the real world. Every little detail 
    has to be taken into account, but today I chose to redesign the credit card 
    input.
</p>
<blockquote class="pull">
    Every question a user has to ask themselves during the checkout process is 
    another reason for them not to complete it.
</blockquote>
<p>
    And yet, the user has to ask themselves so many to simply hand over the 
    information necessary to make his or her purchase. In the average credit 
    card form, it's common to find
</p>
<ul>
    <li>a cluster of randomly-ordered form fields;</li>
    <li>inconsistent formatting requirements;</li>
    <li>poor, confusing labeling;</li>
    <li>complex instructions about how to find things like the CVC (Card 
        Validation Code) for each different card product.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
"Am I supposed to enter my card number with the spaces?"<br>
"Okay, the month on the card is 7... So that's January, February, March, April, May, June, July..."<br>
"What's a CCID? Is that the same as a CCV?"<br>
"What the hell is a CCV?!"<br>
"There are four digits here instead of three..."<br>
"Why does it keep saying my card number is too short?"
</blockquote>
<p>
    All things I've heard from users trying to purchase things online.
</p>
<p>
    Surprisingly, most of these problems are addressed by the cards 
    themselves. You'll notice that no credit card labels its fields -- with the 
    exception of the Card Validation Code (CVC), it's clear by their position 
    on the card, and their content.
</p>
<p>
    Moreover, you can pass someone a credit card anywhere in the world, and 
    they know what they're holding before they even see a Visa logo. There's a 
    significance embodied in the form; it has become a tool for creating a 
    transaction -- fork over your card, and in exchange you receive your purchase.
</p>
<p>
    Importing this significance into the online purchasing experience is the 
    next logical step. Given that the form and layout are significant and can 
    potentially improve the experience of making a credit card purchase, this 
    is a perfect application of <em>skeuomorphism</em>.
</p>
<p>
    Those of you paying attention to iOS (and design in general) have probably 
    heard the word <em>skeuomorphism</em> a lot lately -- and, if you're 
    anything like most people, have had to pull out the dictionary. For the 
    uninitiated, <em>skeuomorphism</em> is defined as "a derivative object that 
    retains ornamental design cues to structures that were necessary in the 
    original." There's been a backlash against it recently -- probably because 
    it's so commonly misused. In iOS, it roughly translated into woodgrain 
    <em>everywhere</em>, lots of realistic-looking knobs and controls and, at 
    the end of the day, an interface that any user, regardless of their smart-
    phone savvy, could pick up and figure out in a couple of minutes.
</p>
<p>
    By leveraging skeuomorphism and some clever tricks and code, I believe we 
    can bring that same intuition to credit card entry, and enhance the user's 
    perception of the quality of the transaction.
</p>
<p>
    So now the challenge becomes centered around how we can duplicate the 
    interface <em>of</em> and interaction <em>with</em> a credit card in the 
    browser. So I did some research.
</p>
<p>
    The layout of cards, including the positioning of the logo, formatting of 
    names and numbers, etc. is controlled by the companies providing the 
    payment product. Big, stable companies like Visa and Mastercard, who don't 
    change layouts very often. The first six digits of a card provide the 
    card's <em>BIN</em> (Bank Identification Number) -- and not only are they 
    indicative of the type of payment product; they also indicate the issuer, 
    as well. For example: card numbers beginning in 4809** are Capital One 
    Visa Platinum Check Cards; cards beginning in 4913** are Visa Electron 
    cards. There's even a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Issuer_Identification_Numbers" target="_blank">nice list</a> 
    available on Wikipedia.
</p>
<p>
    We can't <em>exactly</em> duplicate every card out there. There are too 
    many background images, logos, etc. We need to extract the essence of the 
    layout, so that the card on screen retains enough visual similarity to the 
    physical card that the user will recognize it.
</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/assets/img/skeuocard/card-similarities.png" style="max-width: 810px; max-height: 739px;">
</figure>
<p>
    As we're never forced to actually enter information on our credit cards, we 
    have to construct an interaction around that process; however, if we add a 
    touch of skeuomorphism to the interaction -- the flip of the card -- we end 
    up with an interaction that both delights the user, and is informative of 
    the next step:
</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/assets/img/skeuocard/user-flow.png" style="max-width: 828px; max-height: 1668px;">
</figure>
<p>
But the real weight of this design is in the details of the inputs themselves. 
When a user enters their card number, the layout of the card is changed, as are 
the formatting requirements of the inputs. Not only does that change need to be 
smooth, it needs to be forgiving. 
</p>

<p>
    Users should be able to enter their card information correctly even if they 
    aren't paying attention. The challenge of this starts revealing itself when 
    you go to use it: if a user enters a space between card number groups while 
    they're looking at their card number, we need to catch and remove that. If 
    they continue entering their number past the length of the end of a group, 
    we need to move them to the next group.
</p>
<p>
    But, in order to leverage skeuomorphism properly, the implementation has to 
    shift focus from the accuracy of single inputs to the accuracy of the card 
    as a whole. We want people to hold up their credit card and compare it 
    directly with the card on their screen. The question they should be asking 
    themselves is "does it look the same?"
</p>
<blockquote>
The user can compare their card directly with the resulting output on screen, 
fewer input errors are made, and less time is spent reading the form.
</blockquote>
<p>
So I built a plugin that, with a little work, progressively enhances most 
existing credit card forms. I call it Skeuocard, and I hope you enjoy it.
